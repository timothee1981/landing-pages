      bio={`We're Lunar Moths - a duo making music in a tiny apartment in Portland. Our songs are born from 3am recording sessions, too much coffee, and the kind of conversations you only have when the rest of the world is asleep.

We started posting songs on SoundCloud in 2021, never expecting anyone to listen. Three years later, we're still making music the same way - just us, a laptop, and whatever instruments we can find at thrift stores.`}
