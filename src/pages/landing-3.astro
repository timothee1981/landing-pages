      bio={`Growing up in a small town in Vermont, I learned that the most powerful stories are often the simplest ones. My music draws from those quiet moments - early morning light, conversations over coffee, the changing seasons.

After years of playing coffee shops and open mics, I released my debut album 'Wildflowers' in 2023. It's a collection of songs about love, loss, and finding beauty in the everyday.

Now based in Nashville, I continue to write songs that I hope feel like a conversation with an old friend.`}
